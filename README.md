#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A MongoDB database instance (local or cloud-hosted like MongoDB Atlas)

#### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vortext-online-io-games-platform.git
   cd vortext-online-io-games-platform/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.
   ```env
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=5000

   # MongoDB Connection
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

   # JWT Secret for Authentication
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

   # Cloudinary Configuration (for image/game uploads)
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The backend API should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```sh

   ```env
   # The base URL of your backend API
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Run the frontend development server:**
   ```sh
